## ✨ Overview

**JAR** is designed to be a starter template for projects that need:  
- A **frontend** (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- A **backend engine** (Python logic)  
- A **main script** (`main.py`) to glue them together  

The project aims to keep things modular and clean so developers can easily expand and maintain their codebase.

## 🔥 Features
✅ Separation of frontend & backend logic  
✅ Lightweight and modular structure  
✅ Easy to run with a single command  
✅ Extendable for larger applications

Do you want me to make it **minimal & professional (like open-source projects)**, or keep it **fun & creative (with emojis/designs)** like the above?
